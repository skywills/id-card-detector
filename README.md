# Detecting the National Identification Cards


You can use this project to extract information DOB (name, surname, date of birth, etc.) on the identity card. To do this, I'm broke down the problem into sub-problems as below:

- [this project] Identify Regions of Interest (ROI) containing the required information with deep learning
- [this project] Crop the regions identified above
- OCR on the identified region of interest

This project can do object detection + object classification + multiple object detection all at the same time.
